# Message-Mixer-Decoder
Hi Everyone and welcome back!
I've developed another project focusing on the importance of encryption and decryption techniques. This is a great way of boosting confidentiality when working with information and sensitive data.

This project is built on being a message-encryption service that transforms input text while using various ciphers. From there, it displays the encrypted message to the console.

**Instructions:**
To test the program use the following commands:
**Encryption Method**

1. Open the terminal or command prompt on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where the "message-mixer.js" file is located.
3. Run the following command: node message-mixer.js caesar 4
4. Enter your message in the console below with your input
5. Below should be your encoded message!

Now here are the steps if you would like to reverse it:
**Decryption Method**

1. Open the terminal or command prompt on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where the "message-mixer.js" file is located.
3. Run the following command: node message-mixer.js caesar -4
4. Enter your message in the console below with your input(the output from the previous input)
5. Below should be your decoded message!

Let me know what you think!
Stay blessed!
